  ## About 📖

  This portfolio was created using React and Threejs. Why? I play a lot of video games 🎮 and have experience developing with WebGL technologies such as Phaser and Threejs. With these technologies, I feel that I can express my creativity to its fullest potential, as well as demonstrate the ability to integrate some of the different technologies I've picked up as a fullstack software developer. I hope users will enjoy using my portfolio and have fun while they learn more about some of the cool projects I've developed. 

  <!-- The development of this portfolio involved using an imported 3d model of a laptop in React-Three and styling React components on top to simulate my portfolio website 💻. Iframes can be used to display actual static sites onto the 3d space, however, I chose to use components to display my abilities in using React and keep all of the code contained within this repository for easier maintenance. My last topic is the unfolding animation, which is a small demonstration of the state communication between React and Three to trigger animation events or conditionally render pages. -->
