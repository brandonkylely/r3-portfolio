## About

This portfolio is inspired by Bruno Simon's R3F portfolio from Threejs Journey. While the original portfolio concept showcased some cool concepts, it was rather simple in design and I wanted to expand upon some of these ideas. For example, the original concept used an iframe to display a separate HTML/CSS page, but I chose to overlay the pages in React to gain more control over reacting to user input, such as changing the screen's reflection as the user switches tabs.

I also wanted to showcase the fun of using a 3d space while also trying to maintain accessibility. I created the laptop opening animation by playing around with the scene graph and then using React hooks to set up rotation along an axis. It was a really fun feature to implement, and from a design aspect, I really enjoyed having a subtle, yet theatrical introduction to my portfolio.

I believe that Three.js is a powerful frontend tool, and if used correctly, it can be very effective at grabbing a user's attention. Working with WebGL poses it's own unique challenges, such as camera-relative transformations, animation loops, and dreaded performance issues. However, I believe that it's a worthwhile technology to learn due to the novelty it can provide to web applications and simply the enjoyment of learning it!
